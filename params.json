Please be aware that I am working on my coding skills in C#, and never before have learned a programming language, so please go easy on my first programs. But I promise you that I will work on them every single day and improve! Every program will get better, and once I finish C# I can learn more languages! So please-\r\n###ENJOY!\r\n",
